## Challenge Web Development Study Jam 1 – GDGoC Universitas Brawijaya 2025

This repository contains a simple personal profile website built as part of the **Web Development GDGoC Universitas Brawijaya 2025** assignment.  
The project is intentionally implemented using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to strengthen core front‑end fundamentals.

### Tech Stack & Approach

- **HTML**:
  - Uses **semantic HTML5 elements** (such as `header`, `nav`, `section`, `footer`) to keep the structure clean, accessible, and easy to maintain.
- **CSS**:
  - Written in plain CSS in `assets/style.css`.
  - Class naming follows the **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology for modular and reusable components, inspired by the official guide at [getbem.com](https://getbem.com/).
  - Common colors and shadows are extracted into CSS variables to keep the design consistent and easier to tweak.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Vanilla JS in `assets/script.js`.
  - Adds a **typing effect** on the hero section
  - Handles basic **form submission** on the Contact page

### Project Structure

- `index.html` – Home page with hero section and quick stats.
- `about.html` – About section, tech stack, and achievements.
